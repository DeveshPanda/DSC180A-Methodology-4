## Quarter 2 Project

**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?** 

Exploring audio manipulation and building an interactive playback controller, particularly the slider that adjusts playback rate in real time, was the most engaging topic this quarter.


**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

I would like to explore integrating facial or hand gesture recognition to dynamically control audio speed through real-time human input.

**3. What is a potential change you’d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**  

I would focus more on refining the rewind functionality of the scrubber, as it presented the most complexity in implementation and user experience. I believe it is the most important feature to correct.

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**  

I’m interested in applying a large language model or api for intelligent playback control, such as using gesture recognition models to influence the audio.
